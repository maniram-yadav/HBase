#### What is HBase ?

HBase is an open source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's Bigtable and is written in Java. 
It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of 
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), providing Bigtable-like capabilities for Hadoop.
That is, it provides a fault-tolerant way of storing large quantities of sparse data 
(small amounts of information caught within a large collection of empty or unimportant data,
such as finding the 50 largest items in a group of 2 billion records, or finding the non-zero 
items representing less than 0.1% of a huge collection).

This tutorial covers all the theory and Programming part of HBase Framework.
